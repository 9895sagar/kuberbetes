--- minikube ip
--- curl -L http://minikube ip:30007/demo -v

To create ingress resources
--- kubectl create -f ingress.yml
--- kubectl apply -f ingress.yml

To check Ingress Controller installed or not
--- kubectl get pod -A | grep nginx

To install Nginx Ingress Controller on minikube cluster
--- minikube addons enable ingress

How to check Ingress resources
